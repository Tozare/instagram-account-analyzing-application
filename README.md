## Updates

* App is still in development
* Weekly updates of the code

## Motivation
<p>
  Due to the enormous amount of negativity in Instagram, we decided to provide an app that will diminish the hateful comments from other users and take measures to prevent it. In other words, we want to make Instagram a more safe platform for everyone. This will be done by analyzing comments, direct messages to find negative, positive, neutral comments and give opportunity to delete negative comments and block users that wrote that.
